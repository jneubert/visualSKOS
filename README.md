# Introduction

visualSKOS aims to provide a nice graphical visualization of an SKOS graph. It builds heavily on [visualRDF](https://github.com/alangrafu/visualRDF).

visualRDF is a one night-fork from visualSPARQL (see alangrafu's profile for more projects).
It will probably stay in this status for a while.

visualRDF uses [d3.js](http://mbostock.github.com/d3/) for rendering and [ARC2](https://github.com/semsol/arc2) for parsing RDF.

If you have any comments, bug reports, etc. Please create an issue on github.
